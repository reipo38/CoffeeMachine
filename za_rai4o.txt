"Terminal Trash" - A Diss Track for Linux Users

(Verse 1)
Yo, you think you're slick, flexin' that command line,
Typing sudo like it’s magic, but it ain’t sublime.
Your distro's a mess, can’t make up your mind,
Ubuntu? Fedora? Your options ain't refined.

You act so elite with your penguin crew,
"Open source forever"—yeah, good for you.
But where's your games, bro? Oh, they’re missing in action,
I'll be booting up real fun, no wine attraction.

(Chorus)
Linux heads, caught in their shell,
Living in a kernel, it's a nerdy jail.
Talkin' 'bout freedom, but it's hard to tell,
'Cause your system crashes harder than an old Dell.

(Verse 2)
Man, your desktop’s a joke, it’s like 1999,
You call it innovation? I call it decline.
Spend hours tweaking, like it’s an obsession,
Meanwhile, I’m out here crushing every session.

Pacman this, Apt-get that,
Still can't figure why your screen went black.
Drivers missing, bro? Better Google it quick,
Oh wait, forums said, "Try this ancient trick!"

(Chorus)
Linux heads, caught in their shell,
Living in a kernel, it's a nerdy jail.
Talkin' 'bout freedom, but it’s hard to tell,
'Cause your system crashes harder than an old Dell.

(Bridge)
You laugh at Windows, call it trash from the past,
But my updates take seconds, yours take an hour to last.
Mac users wave, while you're busy compiling,
Meanwhile, we’re out here just effortlessly styling.

(Outro)
So keep your tux logo and your endless debate,
While the world moves on, you can sit there and hate.
Linux is cool? Nah, it's just a phase,
Welcome to the real world—this ain’t your place.

Mic dropped, reboot your pride.
